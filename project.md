In the complex topography of the semi-arid Peruvian Andes, the strong gradients
of temperature and precipitation have shaped the local agriculture. Traditional
farming practices rely on experience gained by generations of farmers about the
local weather and climate.

Recent climate change, which coincides with increasing food and water demand from the
expanding cities, has transformed and challenged the small-scale subsidence
farming. In order to develop efficient adaptation strategies, it is crucial
to
- **better quantify the recent variability and change of climate variables
relevant for rain-fed agriculture**
- **identify the most resilient crops
and agricultural methods for present and expected near-future climate conditions**.

In this project, we follow a transdisciplinary strategy combining atmospheric
and crop modelling with in-situ and remote sensing observations, as well as
interactions with local farmers and scientists. We aim to merge these data and
methods to identify the main vulnerabilities of todayâ€™s farming practices and
develop a model framework that can be used to address agroclimatic research
questions in the region. This tool will form the scientific basis for a series of
practical recommendations oriented towards local stake holders and communities.

Our [study area](/region) spans a west-east transect from the Cordillera Negra
to the Cordillera Blanca at the latitude of the city of Huaraz.
Our [team](/about), originating from various countries and backgrounds, is joined
by a strong network of international collaborations and by a team of
Peruvian scientists, field workers and farmers.
