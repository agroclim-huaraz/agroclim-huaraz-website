In the process of proposal writing we had to remove a few analyzes that, although
interesting, didn't make it to the final proposal for reasons of space. Since
I like them a lot, I thought I would share them here.

The first graphic shows a map of the annual rainfall (mm yr-1) averaged for the
period 1998-2009. These are precipitation *estimates*, i.e. not directly
measured but inferred from satellite data. The climatologies are provided at
~5km resolution by [Bookhagen & Strecker (2008)](http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~bodo/TRMM/).

This graphic tells us a lot. First, it shows the very large **gradient of
precipitation** between the wet amazonian basin (> 3000 mm precipitation per year)
and the very dry Pacific coast (< 50 mm per year). Then, it demonstrates the
**strong influence of orography on the precipitation patterns**, with high mountain
ridges receiving more precipitation than the low lying valleys. This is a well
known process, but the exact patterns and physical mechanisms vary from one
mountain range to another. Finding out what's going on in our region in
particular will be one of the goals of our research project. Finally, one
can see that there is also a gradient along our transect: the Cordillera Negra
("black", i.e. no snow or glaciers) in the west appears dryer than the
Cordillera Blanca ("white") in the east. **This is confirmed by our
[preliminary observations]({{site.base_url}}/live) along the transect**.

The second graphic shows a map of the [temporal correlation (r)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)
of each grid point's monthly precipitation timeseries with the Huaraz grid point timeseries as reference.
The data, obtained from the TRMM V7 gridded precipitation data at ~27km resolution
is coarser than above but has a temporal resolution of 1 month and covers the
period 1998-2014.

A high value indicates that this location's monthly precipitation varies
similarly to the reference location, here on the west of Huaraz. A striking
feature of this map is the very **low correlation between the Cordillera Negra
and Blanca precipitation**, in particular the higher, northern part.
Along the transect, the correlation also switches from high to low values,
which is indicating that certain wet spells or droughts might happen on one
side of the valley but not on others on certain years. **This has yet to be
confirmed (or not!) by our observations**, which cover only two seasons.

While these data are very valuable, they are of coarse resolution and have large
uncertainties: **in our project, we will produce a new high-resolution precipitation
and climate dataset to fill these gaps in knowledge and data availability**.
