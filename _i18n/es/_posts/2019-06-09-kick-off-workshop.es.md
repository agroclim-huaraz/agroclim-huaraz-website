La "AgroClim Huaraz Kick-Off Meeting" took place in Innsbruck last week! For
two days (05th and 06th of June 2019), the project members and collaborators
met in a friendly atmosphere. We heard scientific presentations from the
participants and had important discussions about the
upcoming field work and intensive observation period in September.

We were very lucky to welcome our Peruvian colleagues Alejo Cochachín Rapre
and Rolando Cruz Encarnación (Autoridad Nacional de Agua) for the week.
Fortunately, the weather was very good (almost *too* good maybe?) and allowed us
to have a wonderful workshop dinner at the Umbrüggler Alm, high up above the
city.
