From September 13th to  a team of three scientists from the AgroClim-Huaraz project
traveled to Peru for the first and most important field work of the project.

Our main objectives was to install an eddy-covariance station on the
field of our partner and friend Hector, farmer in Llupa. We also wanted to
get acquainted with the region and our local partners, as well as preparing the
in-situ measurement campaigns of our PhD student Lorenz, who will spend
several months on site.

I was quite nervous before the trip, because of many uncertainties regarding
the location of the station and whether or not it would be sustainable to
let it run for such a long period. It turned out that my fears were unjustified,
and the campaign was a tremendous success!

We will read more about our work there in the upcoming months. In the mean
time, here are a few impressions from the trip:
