Our project is well represented at the EGU session about
[Recent progress in understanding the hydro-climate system of the Andes: Physical processes and resources for Andean populations](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/displays/36767),
to be "chatted" on Tuesday 05 May, 14:00-15:45.

Lorenz will present first results from field observations with the EC station
and the EcoBot ([link to abstract and presentation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-17630.html)),
and I will present new results about the relationship of rainfall and convection
in the Rio Santa Basin to large-scale circulation factors
([link to abstract and presentation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-19981.html)).

Looking forward for exiting discussions this afternoon!
