The first paper of Lorenz's PhD is now out for review in the open access and open discussion journal Earth System Dynamics! You can read the manuscript [here](https://esd.copernicus.org/preprints/esd-2021-60/).

In this study, we use vegetation indices (mostly: NDVI) to see if they can tell us something about local agricultural practices and, most importantly, about climate variability in the region. Started as a "fallback" project, at the moment where everything related to field work was falling apart because of COVID, this study turned out to be very interesting and a perfect fit for the project. We are hoping for constructive reviews! More about the study will be written here when it is (hopefully) published!
