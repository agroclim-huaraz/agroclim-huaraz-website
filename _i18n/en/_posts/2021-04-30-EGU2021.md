If you are participating at the virtual EGU conference this year, come talk to us in Session CL2.8 
"[Phenology and seasonality in climate change](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/40780)"!

I will present the results of the study I am currently working on, utilizing remote sensing retrievals of vegetation indices to infer 
information about precipitation variability in the Rio Santa ([link to abstract and presentation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/EGU21-8330.html)).

I am looking forward for exiting discussions!
