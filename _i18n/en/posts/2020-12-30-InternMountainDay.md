On December, 11th I was invited to celebrate International Mountain Day and speak on behalf of the project. Together with other PhD students we discussed both professionally but also personally how mountains matter to us and consequently how our research related to our personal understanding of the topic.

The event was recorded and can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8AYXHHcrTo

**Some Highlights:**
- Storytelling format presentations of PhD researchers
- @min45:00 Ana√Øs Zimmer from University of Texas presents first results from Coordillera Blanca Grazing Experiment with Llamas!
- hopefully we can all meet physically @IMC2022: https://www.uibk.ac.at/congress/imc2022/
