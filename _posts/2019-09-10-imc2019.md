The [International Mountain Conference](https://www.uibk.ac.at/congress/imc2019/index.html.en)
took place in Innsbruck from September 08 to 12. Our project was very
well represented, with two posters from our group! The first poster was
presented by our Master Student Cornelia Klein in the fantastic outdoor poster exhibition
of the IMC:

Here is Cornelia describing them at the outdoor poster session at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IMC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IMC</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Innsbruck?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Innsbruck</a> <a href="https://t.co/4LLLPNioJh">pic.twitter.com/4LLLPNioJh</a></p>&mdash; Fabien Maussion (@FabClimate) <a href="https://twitter.com/FabClimate/status/1171543007948132353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It was a great conference, and the perfect way for us to meet many scientists
working in the region!
